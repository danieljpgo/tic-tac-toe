## Project
The project is a tic-tac-toe game, where you can play freely, rewind your steps, restart at any time and everything beautifully animated, in addition, saving your progress, even closing the browser, so you can continue playing whenever you want.

## Goals
The goal of this project was to learn the concepts of utility-first CSS and have my first contact with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). In addition, learn even more about [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) animation library. Finally, go deeper into the concepts and advantages of developing more integration tests, as opposed to unit tests using [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/).
